                    <p class="text">Day 5 - Last day of Spring Break Camp, extremely awesome and full of pride! We kicked off by a Kahoot game to review Python syntax and spent the whole day for finishing the games and debugging. Jordan started the day by overwhelming tasks and ran into lots of bugs such as indentation and if-else logic but he made it really far to complete his game as mostly expected. Myles was very independent and strong from setup to finish his game, he only needed help with some Pygame syntax and correcting if conditions and his game turned out really nice. Kaiden was always full of energy and caught up things very fast, he wrote lots of codes for his game and just needs to refactor them later on. No words can describe how much I enjoyed and impressed by your critical thinking, your logic, your energy as well as your sense of programming, excellent works guys! Keep coding.</p>

                    <p class="text">Day 4 Camp, wow it's already day 4 but I am proud to see each of you are so hungry to add new features into your game. We spend all day today to just code and debug for the games. I helped Jordan with setting up if-else logic and variables properly, instructed Myles to debug and to control events to happen in sequence, and guided Kaiden to fix for loops and variables. Exhaustedly but fun and I am sure you learnt a lot to critically define an error, to look for resources and to implement concepts, look forward to seeing your final works guys!</p>

                    <p class="text">Day 3 Camp was awesome. After tackling one coding challenge in the morning, Kaiden, Myles and Jordan all dived into writing codes for their games. Kaiden got to review Class in Python, Myles realized his original game was too complex to implement and pivot to a new one but he caught up very fast, Jordan got to set up movements of characters. They are getting more hands-on and familiar with Python syntax and always raised good questions to chase their thoughts till implemented. Excellent guys!</p>

                    <p class="text">Day 2 Camp we started by helping Myles to install Pygame. After that, all students jumped into writing first lines of codes for their games from loading and displaying background and characters to controlling movement of characters by different key buttons. We discussed about concepts and I helped more with debugging. When it comes to implementation, they are all excited with "Oh I got it, let me do it". Afternoon was kicked off by a Kahoot game which got students to review CS fundamentals: list and function. You guys are doing great, keep it up, I look forward to seeing what comes out of your thoughts and efforts!</p>

                    <p class="text">Day 1 Spring Break Camp was great. I started off by introducing CodeCombat to Jordan, Kaiden and Myles and they all enjoyed playing it as well as performing very well. After that we moved on to playing Kahoot game and reviewing Python basics such as variables, conditional statement, function, list and loop. I am impressed that all students have a very strong base of knowledge and pick up things very fast. In the afternoon, students got to discuss about what they want to develop then solve more problems on Codingbat to practice writing syntax as well as develop thought process. They seems to get the idea to solve very fast but still need to write more Python codes. Lastly, we installed Python and Pygame to start projects tomorrow. 
                        Amazing job today guys!

Excellent job Curtis, I like to see how quickly you come up with an approach to tackle a problem. 

                        Nathanael was trying to add more balls into his Chasing ball by following what he did before with 1 ball, he got a bug but finally got it work by differentiating variables. Great job Nathanael, keep pushing yourself further and adding more advanced stuff into your game!

                    <p class="text">Aracely started fresh with Tic tac toe game. In this game, she used Python list to contain all the dash then use indices of elements in the list to put "X" and "O" into positions dynamically. One big thing she took away from this class is to break down a problem into steps and tackle one by one, starting with a basic. Overall great job in following and collaborating Aracely!

                        Arielle continued with her Pinterest-like website (for comics). She got to implement image hovering using HTML and CSS today, after that we started making hamburger menu and trying to get it function with dropdown. Next class, we will keep going with this.

She will need to practice using list more (https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp) and sharpen her thought process to break down a problem into steps and then solve every step one by one.

                        Yaesh was using if-else to set conditions and get something happen for his age-asking game. He needs to learn more about planning for a game, understanding what's needed to make the game before stepping into codes. Besides, while coding, always start by questions, if you have right questions you will have right approach to the answer, this is even more important than an answer itself, this is how you learn to think.I hope to see both of you put more effort into this.

                    <p class="text">Arnita did a very good job in making Christmas card today using turtle module of Python. Every question I asked to guide her she was picking up and answering very well. By using the built-in methods to draw out shapes into a Christmas tree, she demonstrated a thinking on her feet when it comes to numbers and math. She enjoyed writing every line of code too so keep it up Arnita!

                    <p class="text">Nhi did an excellent job today in making Guessing game on Trinket by applying if else and math logic. She showed her enthusiasm and had lots of good questions as well as tried to debug along the way, she can make so much further with this progress. Rhishi was developing his PI calculating game today using Python. I am totally impressed by seeing him taking lead to plan out the game, to set up the logic and to ask only several questions to make his game happen as expected. He shows great understanding about math and logic, and strong Python coding skill. Not to mention, even when his code was not saved, he made it to rewrite and got it accomplished. You guys rocked !

The game worked well, good job Nathanael. Curtis continued polishing his 2048 game. I am amazed that every session he brings up a new challenge and always use his critical thinking to figure out what makes more sense. Even though we broke the code apart to reexamine its logic and have not got our imagination happen yet, I believed he is growing by having this kind of experience to look back his previous code and make it better.

                        John continued to add more quizzes into his quiz game. The only bug he had was using a variable without defining it in advance and I helped him to fix that. After finishing his project, he did several levels on CodeCombat.
